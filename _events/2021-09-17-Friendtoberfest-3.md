You're all invited to come to Minneapolis for a fun weekend of Oktoberfest activities. We will party at the house and will spend time at Utepils since they will have a giant tent with concerts.

What I can guarantee will happen:

- Me in lederhosen
- 1/4 to 1/2 keg of the finest Oktoberfest beer
- Brats, schnitzels and spaetzle
- Good time with quality people

What may or may not happen:

- Dancing / singing on top of tables
- Clydesdale horses as a mode of transportation

My ask of you:

- Let me know if you are attending so I know how much beer to buy (confirm via this invite and text)
- Let me know if you're planning on staying over or not and we can discuss living arrangements. The garage has A/C and a heating unit so we can certainly set up card board boxes, cots, bunk beds, etc. to accommodate
- Bring your own liter stein, lederhosen and dirdl!

See you there!

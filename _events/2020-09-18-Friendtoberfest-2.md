Boys, It's my favorite time of the year - Oktoberfest season. Breweries are releasing their Oktoberfest line this coming weekend. I can't help but smile whenever I drink an Oktoberfest beer. I'm not sure if you guys are still interested in coming, but I hope you are all considering it.

Logistics: If you guys have vacation days available, I suggest taking that Friday or Monday off? It might be good to have a long weekend to recover. If you guys are coming, let me know since I'll probably get a 30-40 Liter keg so that's about 4-5 Ma√ü for each of us that weekend.

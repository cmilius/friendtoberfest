It's that time of the year! You are all invited to the 4th annual Friendtoberfest celebration. Join us for a weekend of Gem√ºtlichkeit (a German-language word used to convey the idea of a state or feeling of warmth, friendliness, and good cheer).

Our guest list is approaching 30+ people. Please confirm / RSVP so I know how much food to prepare. You're also free to bring friends (just check in before so I know how many people to expect).

Here's what you can expect at the house on Friday:

- Unlimited beer, wine, seltzer, non-alcoholic drinks
- Food - spaetzle, brats, rotisserie chicken
- Bonfire
- Makeshift photobooth

*It's supposed to be chilly and rainy so dress appropriately.

Friday, 9/23
Note: Meet us in the beer garden when you arrive! Wear your dirndl and lederhosen if you have them. Bring a stein if you have one.
